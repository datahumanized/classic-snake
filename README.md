# 🐍 Classic Snake Game (Python)

A clean and modular implementation of the classic Snake game built using Python.  
This project focuses on **object-oriented design**, **file handling**, and **game logic**, making it a strong beginner-to-intermediate level project.

## 🚀 Overview

The player controls a snake that grows in length by eating food. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.  
The game also tracks and **persists the high score** using file operations.
